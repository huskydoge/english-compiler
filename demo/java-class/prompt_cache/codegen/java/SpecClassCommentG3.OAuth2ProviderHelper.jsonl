{"prompt":"The following is the comment block segment for the OAuth2ProviderHelper class / interface\n\n```\n/**\n * OAuth2ProviderHelper is a utility class used to simplify the integration of OAuth2 authentication with existing Java API servers.\n * It provides an easy way to authenticate users and get their identity, as well as to provide a secure authentication system.\n * \n * This class helps facilitate the following flow between a client (via a browser), a server (the server program using this class), and a provider (such as Github or Google):\n * \n * 1. The client sends a request to the server to initiate the OAuth 2.0 flow.\n * 2. The server responds by redirecting the client to the identity provider's authorization endpoint. This redirect includes a unique authorization code, which the identity provider uses to identify the client and the server.\n * 3. The client is redirected to the identity provider's login page, where the user is asked to log in and grant the client access to the requested resources.\n * 4. If the user grants access, the identity redirects the client to the server (redirectURL), which includes the authorization code.\n * 5. The client sends the authorization code to the server.\n * 6. The server exchanges the authorization code for an access token.\n * 7. The server uses the access token to get the client's unique identity.\n * 8. The server validates the identity and logs the user into the server application (outside the scope of this class).\n * \n * This class provides the following public methods:\n * \n * - getAuthorizationSessionUrl(): Returns the authorization session URL (String), this should be used to redirect the user.\n * - getValidAccessToken(code): Returns a valid access token (String), requires the response code given to user when they are redirected back to redirectURL.\n * - getIdentity(token): Returns the identity of the user (String).\n * \n * Any exceptions thrown by the class will be of type RuntimeException.\n */\n```\n\ndeveloper:\nPlease rewrite the OAuth2ProviderHelper comment block, for improved readability.\n\nReturn only the comment block.\n\nAI:\n```\n","completion":"/**\n * OAuth2ProviderHelper is a utility class used to simplify the integration of OAuth2 authentication with existing Java API servers.\n * It provides an easy way to authenticate users and get their identity, as well as to provide a secure authentication system.\n * \n * This class helps facilitate the following flow between a client (via a browser), a server (the server program using this class), and a provider (such as Github or Google):\n * \n * 1.
